# Introduction

Alpha UI is a collection of beautifully designed components with smooth animations built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Motion.

## Philosophy

**I personally believe that good design contributes significant value to software. It's one of the main methods of establishing trust between you and an internet stranger.** Trust is important for internet businesses because it is the first thing a visitor evaluates before pulling out their credit card and becoming a customer.

Some questions visitors might ask themselves are:

- "Is this company legit?"
- "Who else is using it?"
- "Can I trust them with my personal data?"

**Poor design reflects poorly on your team.** It comes off as lazy, unfinished, and unstable. It shows that the team doesn't care about user experience.

**Good design indicates that the team behind has their shit together.** I can probably expect good things from them in the future.

It makes me think "if they care so much about these tiny details, they must care a lot about other things in the company, including their customers!".
